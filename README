WARNING:
	This is extremely hot branch! ;D

	Source codes you got hand on are not supposed to work or to be usefull at all.

	// tech:
	All in this branch is meant as temporary place where all scripts
	will be slowly ported to ruby implementation and after that
	all will be integrated into one all-mighty tool.

	// bfu:
	So quickly go away if you are not willing to help with rewriting
	bash/python/perl into pretty (at least at the end ;] ) ruby code.
	
	// jokers:
	Otherwise anything in this repo-branch can destroy any or all of
	your data and dissolve your grandma as side-effect.


Sincerely or smth like that
	Q.S.
